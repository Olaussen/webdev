            <h2>The short life of a master</h2>
            <hr class="middleline">
            <p>
                Born into the jewish family <em>von Schlongenhammer</em> in South-east Austria during the great depression of 1929, Hans quickly discovered that one of the few things that took his mind away from the horrific events surrounding him at
                the time was art. Of course, like most other masters of their craft, he did not know what impact he would have on millions of lives once his art was open to the public.
            </p>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>
                His art was not as popular when he was alive. After he died though, people found his art to be not just beautiful, but almost <em><strong>heartbreaking</strong></em>. He transformed the pain he felt during his tormented life into ecstatic
                beauty. That is something which does not comes easily to a man born and raised during one of the harshest times in our history. No one had ever done it before him, and perhaps no one will ever again.

                Hans von Schlongenhammer was only 22 years old when he died by suicide in 1951. During those years he painted hundreds of paintings. This exhibition shows perhaps one of the most recognizable of them all. Painted in 1944, when Hans was only 15 years old,
                <em><strong>The fieldhouse</strong></em> depictures the house he grew up with on the fields of <em><strong>Eferding</strong></em> with his older sister after his parents died at the hands of the Germans during the Second World War. It
                is one of 5 paintings in a collection he called <em><strong>The art of seduction</strong></em>.

                He was widely known to hide the title of his masterpieces somewhere in his paintings. He loved it almost as much as painting the same motive hundreds of times randomizing the colours using a blindfold when choosing the colour of each element on the fabric
                canvas. I will leave it up to you to find where he hid it in this one.

                    <h3>CSS layout</h3>
                    <p>
                        All of the styling of the website is located in the <em>main.css</em> file located in the same directory as the <em>index.html</em> and <em>index.js</em> files. Every HTML element are children of the main container-div with id
                        -
                        <em><u>container</u></em>. This div has <em>display: flex</em> with <em>flex-direction: column</em>, which places child-elements inside it in column (top to bottom). This is of course what we want, as the website is vertical, not
                        horizontal.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        I purposely wanted the styling to resemble a sheet of paper - as this is both clean and well-presented. The colour scheme combined with different sizes of horizontal lines to separate the different parts of the website makes it easy on the eyes, and simple
                        to read.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The two pictures (Canvas and SVG) have both the same class - <em><u>art</u></em> - and they are located inside a div with id - <em><u>pictures</u></em>. When the screen width is wider that <strong>950 pixels</strong> this div has
                        a normal flex design (left to right), but when the width shrinks to below <strong>950 pixels</strong>, it will change its <em>flex-direction</em> to <em>column</em> so that the pictures both have space on the website. When the
                        screen shrinks even more - to below
                        <strong>575 pixels</strong> in width - the padding on the <em><u>container</u></em>-div reduces from <strong>70 pixels</strong> to <strong>10 pixels</strong> to fit the page. All this helps to dynamically change the website to
                        look optimal on all kinds of devices and screens. Other than this, there are no other special styling than the standard <em>padding/border/margin</em> etc. to make the page visually pleasing.
                    </p>

                    <h3>HTML5 canvas and SVG</h3>
                    <h4>Canvas</h4>
                    <p>
                        I initiated the HTML5 Canvas element with id - <em><u>canvas-art</u></em> - in the <em>index.html</em> file. Before the JS-script starts the drawing of the motive, it uses a function - <em><strong>matchCanvasPixelsToDisplayPixels() </strong></em>-
                        to make sure that the pixel-resolution of the canvas is 1 to 1 like we want it to be. When this is done the canvas behaves as we want it to - and the drawing can commence.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The drawing starts by making the black and white "frame". This is done my using the <em>.fillRect()</em> method for the context and supplying it width the width and height of the canvas - as well as the starting coordinates (which
                        is x = y = 0 in this case). Only this command will make the whole canvas a black rectangle - which we of course do not want. After this we make a <em>.clearRect()</em> method call to make a white rectangle in the middle - followed
                        by a <em>.strokeRect()</em> method call to make the lined-rectangle in between. This makes the illusion of a frame with an actual canvas inside - and it is on this canvas the motive will be drawn.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The rest of the drawing-code is located inside the - <em><strong>drawCanvasArt(random)</strong></em> - function where the <u>random</u> parameter decides if the different parts of the painting should be drawn with random colours.
                        The ground, sky, house body, windows, door and chimney are all made of rectangles in different sizes and shapes with the <em><strong>.fillRect()</strong></em> method. The roof of the house is made up of three lines where the plane
                        they make up is filled with colour. The crosses in the windows are made of simple lines. The last element is the door handle which is a circle made with the <em><strong>.arc()</strong></em> method - where the whole arc is drawn
                        because the door handle is of course a complete circle and not just a part of one.
                    </p>

                    <h4>SVG</h4>
                    <p>
                        Just like with the canvas I initiated the SVG element with an id - <em><u>svg-art</u></em> - in the <em>index.html</em> file. The way the picture is drawn is very similar to the canvas one in that it uses basic shapes filled with
                        colour to do the job. Unlike the canvas art, the SVG art is not drawn using a JS-api, but rather in plain HTML. This said - no shapes are drawn inside the <em>index.html</em> file as I use the jQuery <em><strong>.html()</strong></em>                        method to fill the element with HTML text.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        SVG is easy to draw with as it do not require you to go through many steps to get a shape on the board. I used the same logic when drawing the SVG as I did with the canvas api. The ground and the sky are rectangles - the same with the house body, windows,
                        door and chimney. Just as the canvas api uses the <em><strong>.fillStyle</strong></em> property to choose the colour of the filling, the SVG HTML-elements have their own <em>fill</em> property inside their
                        declaration, making it easy. SVG also have its own 'ellipse' declaration - making it easier to make circles than the canvas. The same goes for the roof - which is a 'polygon' - not three lines with filling.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The frame of the SVG is made up of three rectangles, just like the canvas is. One thing I really like is that you can give individual shapes ids. This makes it easier to change color of these specific shapes when a user interacts with the artwork. This
                        functionality is not as easy to to with the canvas api. One thing which is pretty similar though is that when the user does interact and the colours change, most of the canvas and SVG art is overwritten by another layer of colours.
                        You can look at it as painting over a painting with new paint - over and over again each interaction. With SVG you can use the given id of an element to change its colours, and therefore not overwrite everything. That said - all
                        the colours are randomized on click except the frame - which turns gold!

                    </p>

                    <h3>JavaScript and jQuery</h3>
                    <p>
                        All the code I've written for the website is located inside the <em>index.js</em> file. The file is included into the <em>index.html</em> file at the end of the <u>body</u> tag. The jQuery library is included in the <u>head</u>                        tag, as I want it to be loaded before my code (which uses it).
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        At the top of the <em>index.js</em> file sits the global constants. These are for the canvas api and use of jQuery later. Instead of referencing the jQuery elements multiple times, I made these constants for easy access. All the
                        constants and variables used later in relation to jQuery starts with a <em><strong>$</strong></em>.
                    </p>
                    <h4>jQuery</h4>
                    <p>
                        In this project I use jQuery to solve three problems:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filling elements with HTML</li>
                            <li>Editing CSS</li>
                            <li>Adding listeners (mouse events)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            As I said when talking about SVG I use the <em><strong>.html()</strong></em> method to inject HTML into the SVG element. If this was to be done in plain JavaScript it would take a lot more steps and code to do. With jQuery
                            I just had to put in the HTML as a string parameter and <em>voalá</em> - it appears. The same method is used to change the text on the documentation button when clicking.
                        </p>
                        <hr class="line">
                        <p>
                            Editing the CSS is used when hovering and clicking the interactive parts of the website. You can see this when hovering/clicking the artwork - or the button used to display this documentation. The <em><strong>.css() </strong></em>method
                            is used the same way as writing actual css. You pass in the property name as the first parameter, and the value as the second. It will then change the css of the chosen element to match the provided parameters.
                        </p>
                        <hr class="line">
                        <p>
                            Lastly, jQuery is used for making listeners for these elements:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Canvas art</li>
                                <li>SVG art</li>
                                <li>Documentation show/hide button</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                For the hover listener the <em><strong>.hover()</strong></em> method is used. It will ask for two functions as parameters. What to do when the mouse enters the element and what to do when it leaves. In this case this is
                                quite simple. When the mouse enters the element some sort of colour change somewhere happens to indicate it - and when it leaves everything goes back to the way it was before the hover started. You can see this when hovering
                                the <u>artwork</u> and the <u>documentation button</u>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the click listener the <em><strong>.click()</strong></em> method is used. This is very simple as you just provide what function you want it to run when the element is clicked. When clicking the <u>artwork</u> - the
                                colours will randomize. When clicking the <u>documentation button</u>, the documentation will either show or hide depending on the current visibility. The text on the button will also accordingly to display the correct
                                instructions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have also used the <em><strong>.mousedown()</strong></em> and <em><strong>.mouseup()</strong></em> methods to change the colour of the <u>documentation button</u> as you click. When the mouse button is pressed -the background
                                colour will change - and when its lifted, it will go back to the hover colour. This is to indicate to the user that the button is in fact being pressed.
                            </p>
                        </p>
                        <hr class="line">
                        <p>
                            More specific comments and documentation (JSDoc) can be found in the actual code itself. I have deliberately done most of the DOM-manipulation in JavaScript rather than plain HTML - as I personally think this is a better and cleaner way of doing it. When
                            the elements are static though, I do it in HTML - like this paragraph.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cross browser testing</h3>
                    <p>The website has been tested on three browsers. <em>Google chrome, Mozilla Firefox</em> and <em>Microsoft Edge</em>. This was done by opening the <em>index.html</em> file in the browser and interacting with the website. I had to make
                        sure that clicking and hovering the artwork and the documentation button worked as it should. Also, I tested resizing the window on the browsers to check that the website looked as it should even on tiny windows. I also checked
                        the console for each browser - making sure that there were no warnings or errors. The firefox window can be shrinked to a smaller width than the two others - and I therefore had to make sure that the elements fit the window.</p>
