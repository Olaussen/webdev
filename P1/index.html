            <h2>The short life of a master</h2>
            <hr class="middleline">
            <p>
                Born into the jewish family <i>von Schlongenhammer</i> in South-east Austria during the great depression of 1929, Hans quickly discovered that one of the few things that took his mind away from the horrific events surrounding him at the
                time was art. Of course, like most other masters of their craft, he did not know what impact he would have on millions of lives once his art was open to the public.

                His art was not as popular when he was alive. After he died though, people found his art to be not just beautiful, but almost <i><b>heartbreaking</b></i>. He transformed the pain he felt during his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.
                That is something which does not comes easily to a man born and raised during one of the harshest times in our history. No one had ever done it before him, and perhaps no one will ever again.

                Hans von Schlongenhammer was only 22 years old when he died by suicide in 1951. During those years he painted hundreds of paitings. This exhibition shows perhaps one of the most recognizable of them all. Painted in 1944, when Hans was only 15 years old,
                <i><b>The fieldhouse</b></i> depictures the house he grew up with on the fields of <i><b>Eferding</b></i> with his older sister after his parents died at the hands of the Germans during the Second World War. It is one of 5 paintings in
                a collection he called <i><b>The art of seduction</b></i>.

                He was widely known to hide the title of his masterpieces somewhere in his paintings. He loved it almost as much as painting the same motive hundreds of times randomizing the colours using a blindfold when choosing the colour of each element on the fabric
                canvas. I will leave it up to you to find where he hid it in this one.

                    <p>
                        All of the styling for the website is located inside the <i>main.css</i> file located in the same directory as the <i>index.html</i> and <i>index.js</i> files. Every HTML element are children of the main container-div with id -
                        <i><u>container</u></i>. This div has <i>display: flex</i> with <i>flex-direction: column</i> which places child-elements inside it in column (top to bottom). This is of course what we want, as the website is vertical, not horizontal.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        I purposely wanted the the styling to resemble a sheet of paper - as this is both clean and well-presented. The color-scheme combined with different sizes of horizontal lines to seperate the different parts of the website makes it easy on the eyes, and
                        simple to read.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The two pictures (Canvas and SVG) have both the same class - <i><u>art</u></i> - and they are located inside a div with id - <i><u>pictures</u></i>. When the screen width is wider that <b>950 pixels</b> this div has a normal flex
                        design (left to right), but when the width shrinks to below <b>950 pixels</b>, it will change its <i>flex-direction</i> to <i>column</i> so that the pictures both have space on the website. When the screen shrinks even more - to
                        below
                        <b>575 pixels</b> in width - the padding on the <i><u>container</u></i>-div reduces from <b>70 pixels</b> to <b>30 pixels</b> to fit the page. All this helps to dynamically change the website to look optimal on all kinds of devices
                        and screens. Other than this, there are no other special styling than the standard <i>padding/border/margin</i> etc. to make the page visually pleasing.
                    </p>

                    <h3>HTML5 canvas and SVG</h3>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <h4>Canvas</h4>
                    <p>
                        I initiated the HTML5 Canvas element with id - <i><u>canvas-art</u></i> - in the <i>index.html</i> file. Before the JS-script starts the drawing of the motive, it uses a function - <i><b>matchCanvasPixelsToDisplayPixels() </b></i>-
                        to make sure that the pixel-resolution of the canvas is 1 to 1 like we want it to be. When this is done the canvas behaves as we want it to - and the drawing can commence.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The drawing starts by making the black and white "frame". This is done my using the <i>.fillRect()</i> method for the context and supplying it width the width and height of the canvas - as well as the starting coordinates (which
                        is x = y = 0 in this case). Only this command will make the whole canvas a black rectangle - which we of course do not want. After this we make a <i>.clearRect()</i> method call to make a white rectangle in the middle - followed
                        by a <i>.strokeRect()</i> method call to make the lined-rectangle in between. This makes the illution of a frame with an actual canvas inside - and it is on this canvas the motive will be drawn.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="line">
                    <p>
                        The rest of the drawing-code is located inside the - <i><b>drawCanvasArt(random)</b></i> - function where the <u>random</u> parameter decides if the different parts of the painting should be drawn with random colours. The ground,
                        sky, house body, windows, door and chimney are all made of rectangles in different sizes and shapes with the <i><b>.fillRect()</b></i> method. The roof of the house is made up of 3 lines where the plane they make up is filled with
                        colour. The crosses in the windows are made of simple lines. The last element is the doorhandle which is a circle made with the <i><b>.arc()</b></i> method - where the whole arc is drawn because the doorhandle is of course a whole
                        circle and not just a part of one.
                    </p>
