            <h2>The short life of a master</h2>
            <p>
                Born into the jewish family <i>von Schlongenhammer</i> in South-east Austria during the great depression of 1929, Hans quickly discovered that one of the few things that took his mind away from the horrific events surrounding him at the
                time was art. Of course, like most other masters of their craft, he did not know what impact he would have on millions of lives once his art was open to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                His art was not as popular when he was alive. After he died though, people found his art to be not just beautiful, but almost <i><b>heartbreaking</b></i>. He transformed the pain he felt during his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.
                That is something which does not comes easily to a man born and raised during one of the harshest times in our history. No one had ever done it before him, and perhaps no one will ever again.
            </p>

                Hans von Schlongenhammer was only 22 years old when he died by suicide in 1951. During those years he painted hundreds of paitings. This exhibition shows perhaps one of the most recognizable of them all. Painted in 1944, when Hans was only 15 years old,
                <i><b>The fieldhouse</b></i> depictures the house he grew up with on the fields of <i><b>Eferding</b></i> with his older sister after his parents died at the hands of the Germans during the Second World War. It is one of 5 paintings in
                a collection he called <i><b>The art of seduction</b></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was widely known to hide the title of his masterpieces somewhere in his paintings. I will leave it up to you to find where he hid it in this one.
